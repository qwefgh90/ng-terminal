# NgTerminal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qwefgh90/ng-terminal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qwefgh90/ng-terminal) [![version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ng-terminal.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-terminal) [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]()

NgTerminal is a web terminal that leverages xterm.js on Angular 7+. You can easily add it into your application by adding `<ng-terminal></ng-terminal>` into your component.

NgTerminal provides some features including [xtermjs](https://xtermjs.org/). You can adjust dimensions of a terminal by dragging and to fix the number of rows and cols. New usuful features should be added continuously.

## Install

```
npm install ng-terminal --save
```

## Example

You can run an example in your local environment.

1) git clone https://github.com/qwefgh90/ng-terminal.git
2) npm install
3) npm run lib-build
4) npm run start

## Getting started

`NgTerminalModule` should be imported within **your app module.**

```typescript
import { NgTerminalModule } from 'ng-terminal';
//...
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        NgTerminalModule
    //...
```

Just add `<ng-terminal>` to your `app.component.html`.
And when the application starts, you can see the web terminal to do nothing.

```html
  <ng-terminal #term></ng-terminal>
```

Now you can print or do something on the terminal with `NgTerminal` object which has APIs for developers.
You can get a object by using `@ViewChild` in your component. It is very important that an object of `NgTerminalComponent` is populated after `ngAfterViewInit()` is called.

```typescript
//...
export class YourComponent implements AfterViewInit{
  @ViewChild('term', { static: true }) child: NgTerminal;
  
  ngAfterViewInit(){
    this.child.keyEventInput.subscribe(e => {
      console.log('keyboard event:' + e.domEvent.keyCode + ', ' + e.key);

      const ev = e.domEvent;
      const printable = !ev.altKey && !ev.ctrlKey && !ev.metaKey;

      if (ev.keyCode === 13) {
        this.child.write('\r\n$ ');
      } else if (ev.keyCode === 8) {
        // Do not delete the prompt
        if (this.child.underlying.buffer.active.cursorX > 2) {
          this.child.write('\b \b');
        }
      } else if (printable) {
        this.child.write(e.key);
      }
    })
  }

  //...
```

## API

There are two ways to control the terminal. Calling API which is a interface of NgTerminal provides is a direct way to control the terminal. You can bind a instance by using @ViewChild. Another way is to use input/output properties.

#### NgTerminal (API)

[NgTerminal](https://github.com/qwefgh90/ng-terminal/blob/master/projects/ng-terminal/src/lib/ng-terminal.ts) is a interface to provide public APIs you can call directly. You can get a object by using `@ViewChild` with a type of `NgTerminal`.

```typescript 
  import { NgTerminal } from 'ng-terminal';
  ...
  @ViewChild('term') child: NgTerminal; // for Angular 7
  @ViewChild('term', { static: true }) child: NgTerminal; // for Angular 8
```

#### NgTerminalComponent (input/output properties)

[NgTerminalComponent](https://github.com/qwefgh90/ng-terminal/blob/master/projects/ng-terminal/src/lib/ng-terminal.component.ts) is a component to implement `NgTerminal` and draw the terminal.

```html
<ng-terminal #term [dataSource]="writeSubject" (keyEvent)="onKeyEvent($event)" [displayOption]="displayOptionBounded"></ng-terminal>
```

#### Underlying object

You can control a instance of the xtermjs directly by getting a property of [underlying](https://github.com/qwefgh90/ng-terminal/blob/master/projects/ng-terminal/src/lib/ng-terminal.ts#L27). Check out API of the Terminal from the [API document](https://xtermjs.org/docs/)

#### Control sequences

Control sequences is a programing interface to control terminal emulators. There are functions to return control sequences in a class of `FunctionUsingCSI`.

```typescript
    import { FunctionsUsingCSI } from 'ng-terminal';
    ...
    const sequences = "data..1" + FunctionsUsingCSI.cursorBackward(1) + '2';
    component.write(sequences);
```

You can also find a full set of sequences [here](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h2-Controls-beginning-with-ESC). For example, you can break lines by passing `\x1b[1E` to `write()`. Try in the [sample page](https://qwefgh90.github.io/ng-terminal/)

## Contribution

NgTerminal is developed with Angular CLI. You can always write issue and contribute through PR to **master** branch.
